## Introduction

### Motivation of creating rainyDay
In addition to rising costs of living, young adults just entering the workforce will also be exposed to a barrage of 
new sources of expense and income. Thus, rainyDay was created to aid young working adults in keeping track and managing
their finances well and reaching their financial goals, by providing an easy-to-use and convenient platform to track 
their [inflows and outflows](#glossary).

Despite the availability of several other financial tracking applications, only a handful of them have integrated a 
[Command Line Interface (CLI)](#glossary) into their systems. However, the utilization of a CLI can significantly 
improve the speed and accuracy of user-provided information, even though it may have a steep learning curve. 
To learn more about CLI, please refer to this [resource](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/command-line-for-beginners/).
Considering the convenience and ease of use, we have decided to leverage the advantages of a CLI by developing rainyDay 
with a CLI interface.

This user guide provides an in-depth documentation on how to install and use rainyDay. This guide caters to all users of
rainyDay, from users who are just starting out to advanced users who are looking for extra features they were unaware 
of.

### What rainyDay can do for you
rainyDay supports a variety of features for users to input and view their [transactions](#glossary). Please refer to the

**Viewing related** - View, filter or sort transactions based on criteria  <br>

You will be able to leverage on these features to efficiently track your finances and achieve your financial goals.

Here's the transaction management section of our guide! In this section, we'll cover all the key tasks you'll

we've got you covered. We'll also show you how to filter your transactions and ignore any that are irrelevant to your

* [Deleting a transaction](#deleting-a-transaction)
* [Editing a transaction](#editing-a-transaction)
* [Filter transactions](#filter-statements)
* [Ignoring a transaction](#ignoring-a-transaction)

### Adding a transaction

An integral feature of any budgeting application is to add transactions. The "add" function of rainyDay allows you
to keep track of your inflows and outflows. The following explains how you can add different types of transactions
to rainyDay.

Format: `add [DIRECTION] [DESCRIPTION] [AMOUNT] {CATEGORY} {DATE}`

* `DIRECTION` should be either:
    * `-in` signifying an inflow type of transaction, or
    * `-out` signifying an outflow type of transaction
* `DESCRIPTION` signifies the description of the transaction, consisting of any characters and space
* `AMOUNT` signifies the value of the transaction, needs to be a number more than or equal to 0, with `$` appended
  before the number
* `CATEGORY` is a field representing the category to be tagged with the transaction, where category can contain any
  characters and space, with `-c` appended to the category
* `DATE` is a field representing the date to be tagged with the transaction, where date needs to be in the format
  of `DD/MM/YYYY`, with <br>`-date` appended before the date

> üí°**Tip:**
>    * `DD` is a two-digit number representing the day
>    * `MM` is a two-digit number representing the month
>    * `YYYY` is a four-digit number representing the year

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Amount has a maximum of $21,474,836.47 and will be rounded down to 2 decimal places!

Example of usage:

You had dinner at Haidilao for $500. To add it to rainyDay, the following command can be provided to rainyDay:

```
> add -out Haidilao $500
Done! Added: out for Haidilao, -$500.00
```

You received an allowance of $20 on 01/03/2023. To add it to rainyDay, the following command can be provided
to rainyDay:

```
> add -in Allowance $20 -c Allowance -date 01/03/2023
Done! Added: in for Allowance, +$20.00
```

> üí°**Tip:** The flags `-c` and `-date` can also be used exclusively. The following are also valid formats:
>
> * `add -DIRECTION DESCRIPTION $AMOUNT -c CATEGORY`
> * `add -DIRECTION DESCRIPTION $AMOUNT -date DD/MM/YYYY`

Example of usage:

You had beef noodles for $12. To add it to rainyDay, the following command can be provided to
rainyDay:

```
> add -out beef noodles $12 -c Food and Drinks
Done! Added: out for beef noodles, -$12.00
```

You received your pay of $50000 on 26/03/2023. To add it to rainyDay, the following command can be provided to rainyDay:

### Viewing the transactions

An important aspect to track your finances is to view all the transactions that you have already done before. The "view"
command of rainyDay can list all the transaction added, and the resultant amount of all your inflows and outflows.

Format: `view {TIMESPAN} {-sort}`

* `TIMESPAN` is used to specifically denote how much history to show from the current day.
    * `1d - 31d` is used to view 1 to 31 days of history
    * `1w - 4w`  is used to view 1 to 4 weeks of history
    * `1m - 12m` is used to view 1 to 12 months of history
    * `1y - 10y` is used to view 1 to 10 years of history
* `-sort` can be included to sort entries in ascending order of their absolute value, 
  with inflows displayed before outflows.

> üí°**Tip:** To view all entries you can use -all in place of a specific time in TIMESPAN

```

```
> view 3m -sort
```

### Deleting a transaction

The transactions added into rainyDay are not fixed. For whatever reason that you require deleting any transaction data,
rainyDay's "delete" function supports removing any previous transaction from your overview.

Format: `delete [INDEX]`

* `INDEX` is the transaction number given by rainyDay to a transaction
    * The transaction number can be obtained from [viewing the transactions](#viewing-the-transactions)

Example of usage:
Your current financial report is at the state in the example given in the
[viewing the transactions](#viewing-the-transactions) section.
To delete the transaction with the description "beef noodles", you can use the command:

`delete 3`

The transaction with the description "beef noodles" will be deleted, and the transactions shown to you
subsequently after requesting to view the transactions will be as such: <br>

```
> delete 3
Done, deleted "beef noodles" from the financial report
> view

### Editing a transaction

Should you need to update details in a previous transaction, rainyDay's "edit" function supports changing the details of
a past transaction

Format : `edit [INDEX] [FLAG] {NEWFIELD}`

* The `FLAG` must be one of the following:
    * `-d` to edit the description
    * `-c` to edit the category
    * `-v` to edit the value
    * `-date` to edit the date in `DD/MM/YYYY` format
    * `-in` to change direction to inflow
    * `-out` to change direction to outflow

* No `NEWFIELD` required for changing direction

Example of usage:

After requesting to view the transactions from rainyDay, the following is shown to you:

### Setting a Monthly Budget

After you know how to manage your transactions, you can now set a monthly budget! In the process of keeping track of 
your expenses, you might feel inclined to stick to a budget. rainyDay can help to give you reminders, and encourage you 
to stick to your budget! With a set monthly budget, rainyDay will remind you how much you have spent for the month with
every new expense in the same month.

Format : `setbudget GOAL`

For example, if you would like to set a monthly budget goal of $1000, use the command below:<br>
`setbudget 1000`

```
> setbudget 1000
Monthly Budget Goal set to $1,000.00!
```

An additional message will accompany new expenses on how much you have spent for the month!

```
> add -out noodles $5
Done! Added: out for noodles, -$5.00
You have spent $544.00/$1000.00, Keep it up!
```

If at any point of time you would like to remove this feature, simply set the goal to $0<br>
`setbudget 0`

```
> setbudget 0
Monthly Budget Goal removed!
```

### Shortcuts

Welcome to the shortcuts section of our guide! Shortcuts can be a great way to save time! In this section, we'll show 
you how to create and use shortcuts effectively. Whether you need to add a new shortcut, view an existing one, 
or delete an old one, we'll cover them all. So, if you're ready to start working smarter, not harder, let's dive into 
the world of shortcuts!

 * [Adding a shortcut](#adding-a-shortcut)
 * [Using a shortcut](#using-a-shortcut)
 * [Viewing a shortcut](#viewing-a-shortcut)
 * [Deleting a shortcut](#deleting-a-shortcut)
  
#### Adding a shortcut

If you happen to have certain commands that you find yourself frequently using, rainyDay's shortcuts can make it much
easier to execute those commands!

Format: `shortcut [SHORTCUTNAME] -maps [ACTUALCOMMAND]`

* `SHORTCUTNAME` can be any single word of your choice to save a reference to the actual command
* `ACTUALCOMMAND` is the actual command which you want your shortcut to perform

Example of usage:

You often eat the same noodle dish from your favourite coffee shop. To save yourself the trouble of typing the same
command in full, you could configure the shortcut with the command below.

`shortcut FavLunch -maps add -out noodles $4 -c food`

```
> shortcut FavLunch -maps add -out noodles $4 -c food
Shortcut successfully added
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Your configured shortcut should map to a valid full command for it to work correctly.

#### Using a shortcut

After configuring your shortcuts, you may want to use the shortcut to save yourself the trouble of typing the
full command. This can be done by simply inputting the name of your configured shortcut command.

Format: `[SHORTCUTNAME]`

Example of Usage:

You have configured the shortcut according to the example in the [adding a shortcut](#adding-a-shortcut) section. Now
all you have to do is input the name of your configured shortcut command.

`FavLunch`

```
> FavLunch
Done! Added: out for noodles, -$4.00
```

#### Viewing a shortcut

After configuring all your shortcuts, the `shortcut_view` command can be used to keep track of all your shortcuts
that you have configured.

Example of Usage:

`shortcut_view`

The output will look something like this:

```
shortcut_view
+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|Here are your shortcuts!                                                                         |
+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|Shortcut                           |Mapped Command                                               |
|a                                  |add -in daily salary $5                                      |
|v                                  |view                                                         |
|FavLunch                           |add -out noodles $4 -c food                                  |
+-----------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

#### Deleting a shortcut

At some point, you may discover that the shortcut you configured is no longer useful, or you may have misconfigured a
previously added shortcut. In these situations, the `shortcut_delete` command provided by rainyDay can prove to be quite
handy.

Format: `shortcut_delete [SHORTCUTCOMMAND]`

* `SHORTCUTCOMMAND` The shortcut command that you want deleted

Example of Usage:

You have configured the shortcut according to the example in the [adding a shortcut section](#adding-a-shortcut).
Unfortunately, your favourite coffee shop has closed down, and you are no longer able to enjoy your favourite noodle
dish. Now the shortcut you previously configured is no longer useful. All you have to do is delete the shortcut with the
command below:

`shortcut_delete FavLunch`

[Jump back to features overview](#features-overview)

### Ignoring a transaction

Due to potential certain one-time payments or receivables that you encounter, rainyDay's ignore function can help you
keep a more accurate track of your finances by allowing you to ignore certain transactions from the overall calculation
of your inflow and outflow.
Conversely, the unignore function is to include a transaction that was previously ignored.

Format: `ignore [index]` or `unignore [index]`

* `index` The index of the entry you want to ignore, obtained by using the `view` command

Example of Usage:

You have received a one-time payment from government GST refunds. You would like to keep track of it however do not want
to include it in your budget calculations. After executing the add command, input view to find its index.
